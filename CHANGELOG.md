## [Unreleased]

## [2.18.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Color themes with optional auto-detection. `gui.theme` selects a bundled palette: the original `default` ANSI 16 look, or the Catppuccin presets `catppuccin-latte` (light), `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato` and `catppuccin-mocha` (dark). `theme: auto` inspects the terminal background at startup and picks `catppuccin-mocha` or `catppuccin-latte` to match. Omitting the key or leaving it empty keeps the legacy ANSI 16 palette, so existing configs are unchanged. An unknown name is an error, and hex-based presets need a truecolor terminal (#88)
- Per-color palette overrides on top of any preset, through three optional maps. `themeColors` applies to every preset, while `themeDark` and `themeLight` apply only on dark or light variants, so a single `auto` config can carry both. Precedence is preset, then `themeColors`, then `themeDark` or `themeLight`. Ten keys are overridable (`green`, `blue`, `red`, `yellow`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `orange`, `white`, `gray`, `highlight`) and accept hex, ANSI 16 or ANSI 256 values. Unknown keys and empty values are ignored, and an unrecognized color falls back to the terminal default with a warning shown under `--debug` (#88)

## [2.17.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Create subtasks under the selected issue, from the task list and the Info panel's Sub tab. The parent is set automatically and the type picker is limited to subtask types. The action appears only where a subtask is valid, so epics and existing subtasks are excluded. The key is configurable like the other issue actions (#94)

### Changed

- The create form now names which required fields are still empty on submit, instead of only counting them, so it is clear what to fill in before the request goes out (#94)
- Reporter is now pre-filled with the current user when creating an issue or subtask, matching Jira's own create defaults. It can still be changed or cleared (#94)
- Create errors now split into pre-form and submit stages. A failed fetch of the parent's issue types aborts with a readable message instead of opening an empty form, while submit errors stay inline. Messages carry Jira's own error text instead of an internal request wrapper (#94)

## [2.16.1] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Full unit-test suite across the whole repository, raising coverage from about 50% to about 80% (stdlib `testing`, table-driven cases, race detector). New test linters are enforced in `.golangci.yml` (thelper, tparallel, usetesting, testableexamples, paralleltest) (#92)
- CI runs the test suite with coverage and publishes the total percent to the workflow run summary

### Fixed

- Data race in the author color cache. The shared color map was written without a lock, so rendering many colored author names at once (comments and history) could hit a concurrent map write and crash. Lookups are now guarded by a read-write mutex with double-checked locking (#92)

## [2.16.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Optional Glamour renderer for ADF previews in the detail view and the create form. Set `renderer: glamour` in config.yml to route descriptions and comments through the adf-converter display module and Glamour for richer styling of headings, lists, code blocks and colored text spans. The builtin renderer stays the default. `rendererStyle` (auto, dark, light, notty) selects the Glamour theme. Auto detects the terminal background via lipgloss and can be set explicitly when detection fails under tmux or ssh (#80)
- `--debug <file>` flag that writes structured debug logs to a file for troubleshooting editor launches and other actions (#82)

### Fixed

- Editors configured with arguments in `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` now launch correctly. The value is split shell-style into a binary and its arguments, so `EDITOR="code --wait"` or `EDITOR="nvim --cmd 'set ft=md'"` work instead of trying to exec a binary named after the whole string (#82)

## [2.15.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Pluggable ADF-to-Markdown converter. The roundtrip now goes through an `ADFConverter` interface with two implementations: the builtin converter (default and fallback) and `adf-converter` v0.1.0. Set `converter: adf-converter` in config.yml to enable the placeholder-based converter for lossless preservation of panels, tables, status badges and other complex elements. The active converter flows through the full edit lifecycle, including the create-form description preview (#74)

### Changed

- CI now runs Dependabot updates, `govulncheck` vulnerability scanning, GitHub dependency review and a `make check-demo` build check. The `golangci-lint` version is pinned via go tool directives (#76)

## [2.14.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Custom icons for issue priorities in the list view. Configure via `gui.priorityIcons` map in config.yml. Plain text works too.
- `slugify` template function for custom commands. Use in templates like `git switch -c wip/{{ .Summary | slugify }}` to produce URL- and branch-safe slugs. German umlauts (ä→ae, ß→ss) and other accented letters are transliterated to ASCII (#72)

### Changed

- Branch generation with `git.asciiOnly: true` now transliterates German umlauts (ä→ae, ß→ss) and strips other accents (é→e) instead of dropping non-ASCII characters. Issue types like "Lösung" now produce "loesung" instead of "Lsung" (#72)

## [2.13.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Walk through issue hierarchy from the issues list. Space opens an issue's children, Backspace opens its parent, Esc pops back to the previous view. Each step pushes a snapshot of the panel state so cursor, focus and Info tab are restored on the way back. Children walks also work from the Sub and Lnk tabs in the Info panel. Shares a single ad-hoc tab next to the existing ones, similar to the JQL tab (#68)

### Fixed

- Mouse click and wheel scroll on the issues list now update the active issue. Browser open, copy URL, transition and other actions used to target the previously selected issue because the mouse path skipped the canonical selection update
- Demo build (`make check-demo`) failed to compile after the parent-link children feature landed. The demo client now implements `GetChildren` and returns subtasks of the requested parent

## [2.12.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Custom icons for issue statuses in the list view. Configure via `gui.statusIcons` map in config.yml. Plain text works too (#64)

### Fixed

- Sprint field shows None on Jira instances where the `sprint` alias does not resolve to the real custom field id. The id is now discovered at startup via `/field` and used in both reads and writes. Affects older Server/DC and other instances that map sprint to non-default ids like `customfield_10010` (#48)

## [2.11.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Branch modal: names that do not match an existing remote ref now create a local branch. Previously any `/` in the input forced remote tracking, breaking prefixed conventions like `feature/PROJ-1-foo` (#62)

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Catppuccin theme support. Pick from Latte, Frappé, Macchiato or Mocha via `gui.theme` in config. Default ANSI palette stays the same. Catppuccin flavors use hex colors and need a terminal with truecolor support (#59)

### Changed

- CI step names mirror the `make` targets they run. Failed jobs now point at the exact command to run locally
- CONTRIBUTING documents how to refresh `gomod2nix.toml` after a Go dependency change. Both `nix develop -c make nix-deps` and `go install gomod2nix` paths are listed. Skipping the refresh fails the nix CI job with a checksum error (#60)

## [2.10.2] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Go module path updated to `github.com/textfuel/lazyjira/v2` to follow Go modules v2+ convention

## [2.10.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- String shorthand in `projects` list (e.g. `- ORCH` instead of `- key: ORCH`) no longer panics on startup. Both forms can now be mixed in the same list (#53)

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Configurable custom commands. Bind shell commands to keys with Go template access to the focused issue, project or comment. Commands declare which UI contexts they fire in and take precedence over built-in keys. Includes `suspend` flag and `shellescape` template helper (#42)
- `maxResults` option to control how many issues are fetched per query. Can be set globally or per tab in `issueTabs`. Default remains 50 (#45)
- Context-sensitive preview for Sub/Lnk tabs. Moving the cursor in subtasks or links previews that issue in the detail pane. Actions target the previewed issue. Preview resets when leaving the tab (#55)

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Custom icons for issue types in the list view. Configure via `gui.typeIcons` map in config.yml (#38)
- `gui.collapsedPanelHeight` option to set the height of non-focused side panels. Default is 5 lines which was often too small to read the info panel without switching focus (#46)

## [2.8.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Issue rows no longer wrap to two lines when the panel is narrow. Extra content is cut off instead
- Updated column now lines up vertically. Summary column was not padded so dates floated left on short summaries

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-10

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Search and filter in keybindings help popup. Press `/` in the `?` menu to filter by key or description (#15)
- Scroll detail panel without switching focus. `J`/`K` scrolls one line, `ctrl+f`/`ctrl+b` scrolls half page from any left panel (#20)
- Navigation keys (`j`/`k`/`g`/`G`/`ctrl+d`/`ctrl+u`) are now configurable via `keybinding.navigation` in config.yml

## [2.7.4] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Optimistic UI updates. Fields update on screen instantly without waiting for the API
- All paginated API methods fetch every page. Boards, sprints, changelog and labels were capped at one page
- Custom fields without predefined options fall back to inline input or external editor instead of showing an error
- `SetBuiltinFieldValue` and `PatchIssueFields` helpers for consistent field patching across issue list and info panel

### Fixed

- Overlay stack now renders all visible layers so stacked modals display correctly
- `PatchIssue` syncs all fields including sprint, labels, components and custom fields

## [2.7.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Branch name templates support `{{.ParentKey}}` for subtask workflows like `PROJ-100/PROJ-142_summary` (#34)
- Documented `{{.ProjectKey}}`, `{{.Number}}` and `{{.Type}}` template variables that were available but missing from docs (#34)

### Fixed

- Assignee list was capped at 100 users. Now fetches all pages so large orgs see everyone (#35)

## [2.7.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Edit custom fields in info panel. Supports select, multiselect, person, text and textarea
- Field type auto-detected from Jira value. Can also set `type` in `fields` config
- Fields with explicit `type: text` or `type: textarea` skip the CreateMeta API call
- `multiline` option in `fields` config opens external editor for text fields
- CreateMeta cached per project and issue type so repeated edits skip the API call
- Enter on linked issue opens it in detail view without leaving the info panel
- Space on linked issue navigates to it in the issues list
- Space on issues panel opens issue detail
- Info panel label width adjusts to fit custom field names
- None and Unknown values shown in gray
- Ctrl+J / Ctrl+K as alternative navigation keys everywhere (lists, modals, search)

### Fixed

- Person field edit could update the wrong issue if you changed selection before picking a name
- Auto-refresh no longer jumps detail and info panels when you are focused elsewhere
- Editing a field not available in issue metadata now shows an error instead of an empty input

### Removed

- Issue select feature with star marker and pin-to-top

## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Double-click, git branch detection and issue creation no longer mark issue as active

### Fixed

- Detail panel updates when switching issue tabs with `[]`

- ADF headings wrap to fit panel width

## [2.6.8] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- AUR PKGBUILD: pkgver() now uses git describe for tag-based versioning per Arch Wiki guidelines

## [2.6.7] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Text wrapping now measures display width of Unicode and emoji instead of counting bytes. Panels no longer overflow with multi-byte characters
- Info panel field values truncated by visual width instead of byte length
- ADF list markers use correct display width for indentation
- Stripped carriage returns from wiki markup and ADF text to prevent terminal corruption with Jira Server line endings

## [2.6.6] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Issues list selection no longer jumps to top after confirming search

## [2.6.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew: switched back from Cask to Formula — Cask quarantines unsigned CLI binaries, causing macOS Gatekeeper to block execution

## [2.6.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew tap: removed stale Formula that shadowed the Cask, causing `brew upgrade` to stay on v2.4.0

## [2.6.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew formula not updating since v2.4.0: switched goreleaser from `homebrew_casks` back to `brews`
